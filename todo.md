# Theme/Sketch

- wizard's bridge, connecting two structures

# Floors

# Walls

- might want to break up first building more
- also both floors of second building could use more geometry and/or doors

# Gates

- how to get through door in first building?

# Gameplay

- populate second building halls (maze of shooter traps)
- populate gold key room (columns, more enemies, ammo?)
- adjust groups in final room, maybe add more geometry/items
- no gameplay benefit to windows in first building (need more things to see or snipe, shouldn't be able to trigger demon/ogres - some kind of overhang? or cover the bridge?)
- could use more interesting things in/on the water, maybe islands to explore and more enemies

# Ceilings

- mostly the large outside area and the upper floor of second building

# Detailing

- BUBBLES
- most doors are too tall and probably shouldn't go up to ceilings
- more stalactites in cave
- more windows
- clean up wet back courtyard walls
- support beams for building areas jutting out?
- gold key label on exit door
- inset tracks behind elevators to suggest hidden mechanisms

# Lighting

# Refining

- texture alignment
- geometric polish
