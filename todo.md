# Theme/Sketch

- wizard's bridge, connecting two structures

# Floors

# Walls

- might want to break up first building more
- also both floors of second building could use more geometry and/or doors

# Gates

- how to get through door in first building?

# Gameplay

- could use more interesting things in/on the water, maybe islands to explore and more enemies
- secret area under gold key trap should be lower so it's easier to see an item in it (maybe? try item/lighting first)

# Ceilings

# Detailing

- more stalactites in cave
- more windows
- clean up wet back courtyard walls
- support beams for building areas jutting out?
- gold key label on exit door

# Lighting

# Refining

- texture alignment
- geometric polish

# Issues

- most doors are too tall
- no gameplay benefit to windows in first building (need more things to see or snipe, shouldn't be able to trigger demon/ogres - some kind of overhang? or cover the bridge?)
- ogre can see and shoot through func_illusionary secret (grenade launcher)
- not enough ammo even with all the grunts, should put in more shells
- can have more zombies in entrance, although need to think about issue of not having grenade launcher
        - hide super shotgun and put grenade launcher where nailgun is? then where does nailgun go?
- check that secret armor shows up
