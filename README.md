# The Bridge

A Quake map by Joshua McLean, developed with [TrenchBroom](https://trenchbroom.github.io/).

## Building

Compile with Quake tools such as [EricW's tools](http://ericwa.github.io/ericw-tools/). VIS and LIGHT will fail until the map is closed, which until the final release is not guaranteed.

## Running

You must own a full version of Quake, which is available on all sorts of game stores.

I recommend [quakespasm](http://quakespasm.sourceforge.net/) for a modern experience (since loading maps into the remake is currently a headache).

Put the built BSP in quake/id/maps (you may need to create the maps folder), run the game, then open the console with the backtick key. Check if the file is in the right place with quakespasm using the `maps` command to list available maps, then use `map bridge` to play it.
